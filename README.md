# trade-tariff-tools

This repo is used as a wastebasket for general workflows and scripts that the tariff team need as part of our release and other processes

### bin/fetch-commodities

In order to run this script you will need the [requests library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and a relatively recent version of python (I'm on 3.11.4)

I installed requests by running:

```shell
pip install requests
```

Update the commodities.txt file with your commodities

And run the script with:

```shell
./fetch-commodities
```

In VScode for windows you should be able to right click the python file and hit run

This should print a markdown table you can copy into your Stop Press Notice

For example, this will produce:
